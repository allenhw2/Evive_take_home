Overview:
Since the assignment specifications called for object oriented programming, I went with a class structure for the menu and created separate classes for each meal type.
A simple alternative would be to have it all in one class that utilizted nested dictionarys as the entire menu. One would then process the order and find the keys accordingly. 

One of the main things I tried to focus on while coding is the scalability of code. Especially since the concept is that of a menu, a menu adds and subtracts items all the time. However I had some diffculties in making it as easily scalable as it could without making food classes too complex.
